I currently live in Montana, which is where I was born and raised. When I am not coding,
I enjoy spending time outside. I adore hiking and skiing, although I am not particularly skilled at the later.

I graduated from high school in 2016 and studied Computer Science at Baylor University,
where I graduated magna cum laude. Please check out my Github to see some of my favorite
school projects.

I have always had a deep interest in computers and technology in general. As a kid
I loved playing videogames and as a teenager was commonly fiddling with old computers.
I had quite the spare part collection and was always trying to bring new life to old technology.

# Interests
I love learning about computer science and am always pushing myself to become a better
engineer. I do not shy away from challenging situations and am always willing to assist
or ask for help from others.

I am comfortable working full-stack but specialize in backend development.
